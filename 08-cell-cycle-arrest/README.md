Chronic phosphate limitation (>5hr) has been shown to induce cell cycle arrest, manifested as a steady decrease in the percent of cells with buds in _S. cerevisiae_. This coincides with the inductioin of a "general starvation program" that is associated with large changes in metabolism and upregulation of stress responses, including a number of OSR genes (but do not include _CTT1_ and _CTA1_). Thus, one hypothesis for the divergent ASR phenotype we observed is that _C. glabrata_ enters cell cycle arrest faster than _S. cerevisiae_ and the ASR effect we observed is in fact the manifestation of its general starvation program. To test this hypothesis, Chris Youngstrom in the lab did a time course microsopy to quantify the budding index (% of cells with buds) in both species during phosphate starvation. The experiments were done on 2023/04/07-11
