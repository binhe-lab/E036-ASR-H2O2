| Sc-Cg-ASR-raw.csv | raw ASR CFU data | d072922 to d101922 | Sc, Cg | raw CFU count with dilutions, to make survival rate comparable between species, one need to multiple the count to the dilution; MO/MM is the survival rate without primary stress; PO/PM is the survival rate with phosphate starvation stress |
| MOPO-Sc-Cg-ASR-scatter-plot-d122422.csv | aggregated ASR CFU data | d072922 to d101922 | Sc, Cg | ASR CFU data with r and r' and ASR Score |
| spotting_assay_density.csv | spotting assay processed ASR density data | d042022 | Sc, Cg | ASR spotting assay data measured based on the density of the spots |
| Time_course_ASR.csv | processed ASR CFU assay with different primary stress time | NA | Sc, Cg | processed ASR data in ASR socre in 45min, 90min and 135min primary stress treatment |
