We created a strain with a genomic integration of a GFP after the C-terminus of the endogenous Cta1 protein. Using this recombinant protein as a reporter for phosphate starvation-induced ASR, we examined how various perturbations affected the ASR. The analyses were organized by the type of perturbations and figures

- `20221223-CTA1-Pi-vs-H2O2-fig3.Rmd`: wild type strain under either phosphate starvation or H2O2 stress
- `20221025-tf-promoter-mutants-fig4.Rmd`: examining TF mutants
- `20230202-TORC1-and-CTA1-fig7.Rmd`: rapamycin treatment and rim15-
- Note that Sch9 mutant CTA1 data and analysis are in its own folder `../06-SCH9-3E-CTA1/`
