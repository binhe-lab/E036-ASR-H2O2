Bin made the strain replacing the endogenous _CTA1_ promoter with the promoter of _CgMET3_, allowing for induction using media lacking methionine and cysteine. Lindsey took tfour PCR identified colonies from the transformation along with a no-GFP control (yH001 or yH181) and the host for the transformation, whose promoter of _CTA1_ was replaced with URA3 (yH347). These strains were subject to either mock, -Pi or the inducing condition treatment (-Met -Cys), and Cta1-GFP was measured using flow cytometry. The median fluorescence intensity was recorded.
