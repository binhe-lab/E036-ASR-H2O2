The goal of this set of experiments is to quantify the intracellular ROS levels to determine if phoshate starvation leads to an increased ROS level. The reason for the question is because if phoshate starvation induces ROS compared with hydrogen peroxide, and whether the changes differ between species.

_Reagent and how it works_

This assay uses the cell permeant reagent 2’,7’ –dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFDA, also known as H2DCFDA, DCFH-DA, and DCFH) to quantitatively assess reactive oxygen species in live cell samples. DCFH-DA is a fluorogenic dye that measures hydroxyl, peroxyl and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) activity within the cell. It is based on the diffusion of the dye into the cell, where it is deacetylated by cellular esterases to a non-fluorescent compound, which is later oxidized by ROS into 2’, 7’ –dichlorofluorescein (DCF). DCF is highly fluorescent and is detected by fluorescence spectroscopy with excitation / emission at 485 nm / 535 nm.

_Assay protocol_

1. Grow cells to mid-log phase
2. Spin down the cells, wash
3. Repeat step 2
4. resuspend cells into treatment medium (- Pi, 0.2mM H2O2, 1mM H2O2, 2mM H2O2, 10mM H2O2, etc.) and add 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (Sigma, D6883) into the medium to a final concentration of 50uM
5. incubate the culture for 50 minutes in dark at 30 Celcius degree
6. Wash cell twice with H2O
7. Dilute cells into H2O and run flow cytometry(FSC: 350l SSC:350; BL1: 460) with 30,000 events using the same hard gate for single cells to both species and each treatment
