Test the hypothesis that phosphate starvation differentially repress the Target-of-Rapamycin Complex 1 (TORC1). Given the known regulatory relationship between TORC1 and the activation of TFs including the general stress response TF Msn4 in _S. cerevisiae_, we hypothesize that TORC1 directly contributes to ASR in _C. glabrata_ by signaling phosphate starvation to the downstream stress response regulators. TORC1 has several downstream pathways, including the Sch9 branch, the PP2A branch and supposedly a third one involving Yak3, which has been suggested to be the kinase that phosphorylates Rps6. In the sub-folders of this project, we will examine various reporters that would tell us how the different downstream branches respond to phosphate starvation and other signals.
