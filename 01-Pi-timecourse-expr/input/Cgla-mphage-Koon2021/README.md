This data is kindly provided by Dr. Chris Koon's lab at the University of Macao. A student in his group, Lan Qing, compiled the data and sent us a PPT file that contained both a matrix and some plots. See [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.28.462173) for method details. Briefly, _C. glabrata_ culture was added to human THP-1 differentiated monocyte cells at an MOI of 5:1, and sampled at 0.5h, 2h, 4h, 6h and 8h post infection time points. RNA PolII ChIP-seq was performed in place of RNA-seq. Bioinformatic analyses involved mapping quality-checked short reads to the genome using Bowtie2, feeding the resulting BAM files to MACS2 and calculating a normalized read count (RPKM) for each gene.
